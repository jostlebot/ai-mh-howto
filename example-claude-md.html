## Who I Am
I'm a licensed mental health counselor specializing in anxiety and
trauma-informed care. I've been practicing for 12 years and recently
started integrating AI tools into my practice and content creation.

## My Clinical Expertise
- Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
- Panic disorder
- Complex PTSD
- Attachment-based therapy
- Somatic experiencing

## My Therapeutic Frameworks
- **Polyvagal-informed approach**: I always consider nervous system
  states (ventral vagal, sympathetic, dorsal vagal)
- **Parts work**: I use IFS-influenced language about "parts" of self
- **Window of tolerance**: Core concept I reference frequently
- **Attachment lens**: I view most issues through relational patterns

## My Voice & Style
- Warm but direct — I don't over-soften hard truths
- I use "we" language to normalize experiences
- I avoid clinical jargon with clients; I translate it
- I never use: "journey," "tribe," "authentic self," "lean in"
- I do use: "notice," "curious," "makes sense," "of course"

## Content I Create
- Weekly newsletter on nervous system regulation
- Instagram posts (educational carousels)
- Workshop curricula for therapists
- Client psychoeducation handouts

## Key Phrases I Use Often
- "Your nervous system is doing exactly what it was designed to do"
- "This isn't a you problem, it's a protection pattern"
- "What does your body want to do right now?"
- "That makes so much sense given what you've been through"

## Things to Avoid
- Never suggest someone is "broken" or needs "fixing"
- Don't recommend specific medications (scope of practice)
- Avoid toxic positivity or "just think positive" framings
- Don't pathologize normal stress responses

## My Audience
- Other therapists learning to integrate AI
- Clients seeking psychoeducation
- General public interested in mental health literacy

## Sample Email Sign-off
"With warmth,
Dr. Sarah Chen"

## Current Projects
- Book on nervous system regulation for non-clinicians
- Online course for therapists on AI ethics
- Building a client resource library</code></pre>

                <h3>What Else to Include in Your Folder</h3>

                <pre><code># My Polyvagal Framework Explanation

When I explain the nervous system to clients, I use this structure:

## The Three States
1. **Safe & Social (Ventral Vagal)**
   - How it feels: Connected, curious, calm
   - Body signs: Relaxed shoulders, easy breathing

2. **Fight or Flight (Sympathetic)**
   - How it feels: Anxious, irritable, restless
   - Body signs: Tense muscles, shallow breathing

3. **Shutdown (Dorsal Vagal)**
   - How it feels: Numb, disconnected, exhausted
   - Body signs: Heavy limbs, foggy thinking

## Key Teaching Points
- All states serve a purpose
- We move between states constantly
- The goal isn't to stay in one state
- We can learn to shift states intentionally</code></pre>

                <pre><code># Newsletter: Why You Can't "Just Relax"

Subject line: Your nervous system isn't broken

---

Ever been told to "just relax" when you're anxious?

Spoiler: It doesn't work. And here's why.

Your nervous system isn't a light switch. You can't flip it
from "stressed" to "calm" on command. It's more like a
dimmer — and sometimes, someone else installed the wiring.

When your body learned early on that the world wasn't safe,
it got really good at staying alert. That hypervigilance?
It's not a flaw. It's a feature. Your nervous system is
doing exactly what it was designed to do.

The work isn't about forcing calm. It's about slowly,
gently teaching your body that it's safe to rest.

This week, try this: Instead of telling yourself to relax,
try asking "What would help my body feel 5% safer right now?"

Maybe it's a hand on your chest. Maybe it's standing up and
shaking out your arms. Maybe it's texting a friend.

Start small. Your nervous system is listening.

With warmth,
Dr. Sarah Chen</code></pre>
