            <h2>Building Your Knowledge Base</h2>

            <section class="step">
                <h3>What is a Knowledge Base?</h3>
                <p>A knowledge base is a <strong>collection of your expertise</strong> that AI can reference. Instead of explaining your frameworks, methodologies, and voice every time, you create a foundation that Claude already "knows."</p>
                <p>Imagine having an assistant who has read everything you've ever written and understands how you think. That's what we're building.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <h3>Step 1: Create Your Project Folder</h3>
                <p>First, let's create a dedicated space for your knowledge base.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open Terminal</li>
                    <li>Run these commands:</li>
                </ol>
                <pre><code>mkdir ~/my-knowledge-base
cd ~/my-knowledge-base</code></pre>
                <p>You now have a folder called "my-knowledge-base" in your home directory.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <h3>Step 2: Create Your CLAUDE.md File</h3>
                <p>This special file tells Claude about you and your work. Claude Code automatically reads it.</p>
                <p>Create the file by running Claude Code:</p>
                <pre><code>claude</code></pre>
                <p>Then ask Claude:</p>
                <pre><code>Create a CLAUDE.md file that I can fill in with information about myself and my work</code></pre>
                <p>Claude will create a template for you. Here's what to include:</p>

                <div class="template">
                    <h4>CLAUDE.md Template</h4>
                    <pre><code># About Me

## Who I Am
[Your name, title, what you do]

## My Expertise
[Your areas of specialty in mental health]

## My Frameworks
[Therapeutic approaches you use, methodologies you've developed]

## My Voice
[How you communicate — warm? clinical? conversational?]

## Common Topics I Create Content About
[List the themes you regularly address]

## Important Terms I Use
[Any specific language or concepts unique to your work]</code></pre>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <h3>Step 3: Add Your Content</h3>
                <p>Now add files that represent your expertise:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Past articles or blog posts</strong> (copy as .txt or .md files)</li>
                    <li><strong>Frameworks you've developed</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Common Q&As</strong> you answer</li>
                    <li><strong>Your bio in different lengths</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Example emails or messages</strong> that show your voice</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Create a simple folder structure:</p>
                <pre><code>my-knowledge-base/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── frameworks/
│   └── my-main-framework.md
├── writing-samples/
│   ├── blog-post-1.md
│   └── newsletter-example.md
└── about/
    └── bio-versions.md</code></pre>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <h3>Step 4: Use Your Knowledge Base</h3>
                <p>Now when you run Claude Code from inside your knowledge-base folder, Claude will reference all of it.</p>
                <pre><code>cd ~/my-knowledge-base
claude</code></pre>
                <p>Try prompts like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Write a LinkedIn post about [topic] in my voice"</li>
                    <li>"Draft an email responding to this question: [paste question]"</li>
                    <li>"Create a workshop outline based on my framework"</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <h3>Step 5: Keep It Growing</h3>
                <p>Your knowledge base is a living thing. As you create new content:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add new files to the appropriate folders</li>
                    <li>Update your CLAUDE.md when your thinking evolves</li>
                    <li>Add examples of particularly good work</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The more context you provide, the better Claude can assist you.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quality over quantity</strong> — 10 great examples beat 100 mediocre ones</li>
                    <li><strong>Include failures</strong> — add notes about what NOT to do or say</li>
                    <li><strong>Be specific about voice</strong> — "I never use the word 'journey'" is helpful</li>
                    <li><strong>Update regularly</strong> — your thinking evolves; your knowledge base should too</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <h3>What's Next?</h3>
                <p>With your knowledge base set up, you can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generate content in your voice instantly</li>
                    <li>Build custom tools that understand your work</li>
                    <li>Share your setup with collaborators</li>
                    <li>Create client-facing tools that reflect your expertise</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <div class="next-step">
                <p>You did it! You've learned the foundations.</p>
